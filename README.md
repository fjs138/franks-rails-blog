| File/Folder    	| Purpose           	  |
| :------------------|:-------------------|
| app/	 			| Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers, channels, jobs, and assets.     |
| bin/		 			| Contains the rails script that starts the app and can contain other scripts used to setup, update, deploy, or run your application.    |
