# Frank's Rails' Blog
This is a basic blog developed using Ruby on Rails.

While rather simple, it still utilizes http_basic_authenticate_with for authentication to prevent unauthorized users from modifying content.

You can start the server by invoking bin/rails server followed by using a web browser to connect to http://localhost:3000/articles


Note:
Credentials for logging in are: "name": "frank", "password": "secret",
